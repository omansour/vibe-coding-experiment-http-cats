# Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages
* Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Keep commits focused on single logical changes
* Use conventional commits (see [conventional commit website](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13))
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `style:` for formatting changes
  - `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - `perf:` for performance improvements
  - `test:` for adding or modifying tests
  - `chore:` for changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

# Branch strategy
 * Use feature branches for new work
 * Keep main/master branch stable and deployable

# Use .gitignore properly
* Exclude build artifacts, dependencies, and environment-specific files
